## Starting the Quiz

The first thing the user will see is the title card along with the option to start the quiz. Once the user clicks the "Start" button, the quiz will begin.

## The Questions

Once the quiz has begun, the user has 60 seconds to answer the five questions presented to them. If they get a question right, the screen will turn green, and they get a point! If they answer wrong, no point is awarded and they lose ten seconds from their timer. Answering a question will show which answers were either right or wrong.

## The Game Over Screen

Once all questions have been answered, or time has run out, the page will show the Game Over screen. Here the user will be able to submit their score by clicking on the "Save High Score!" button. This button activates a prompt for the user to input their initials. The score is then saved to the Local Storage on the users browser.
